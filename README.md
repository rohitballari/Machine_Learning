# Predicting Heart Disease using Decision Tree

This project demonstrates how to use a **Decision Tree Classifier** to predict the likelihood of heart disease using a dataset of patient health records. The goal is to provide a simple and interpretable machine learning model for binary classification (heart disease or not).

## 🗂️ Project Structure

- `heart-disease.csv`  
  → Dataset containing various health-related attributes and a target variable indicating heart disease presence.

- `Predicting Heart Disease using Decision Tree.ipynb`  
  → Jupyter Notebook containing all the steps: data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

- `new_image.jpg`  
  → Image used for visualizing or illustrating model performance, structure, or results (e.g., decision tree or accuracy plot).


## 📊 Dataset

The dataset `heart-disease.csv` includes several features related to patients' medical history and clinical measurements (like age, cholesterol, chest pain type, etc.) and a target column indicating the presence of heart disease.

## 📒 Notebook Overview

The notebook `Predicting Heart Disease using Decision Tree.ipynb` includes the following steps:
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Splitting the data into training and test sets
- Training a Decision Tree Classifier
- Evaluating model performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report
- Visualizing the decision tree

## 🖼️ Visualizations

The image file `new_image.jpg` is used to present visual outputs like decision trees, feature importance, or accuracy plots generated during model evaluation.

## 📌 Requirements

Make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

You can install them using:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
